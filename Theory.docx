Low level Design -> deals with the code quality and how different classes of a component interact with each other
Pre -> SOLID, DRY, OOPs

# What are Design Pattern:

They accelerate the developement process.
Typical solution to commpnly occuring problems of system Design
We need not create these pattern everytime the problem arises

# Design Pattern Categorization:

Categorization of design patterns is done on the basis of its purpose

# Creational  
                                 
- Deals with object creation mechanism which increases flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- oops concept followed-> Abstraction -> Client need not know what is happening behind
- examples: Singleton , Factory and Abstract Factory

 # Structural      
 - These patterns explain how to assemble classes and objects to larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient
 - example - Adaptor

 # Behavioral
 - They take care of effective communication between classes and objects
 - example -> strategy, chain of responsibility
